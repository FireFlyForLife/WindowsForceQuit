# WindowsForceQuit
Force a process to close with a hotkey, very useful for when an application is not responding.

## Install program
The executable is portable. So just download the latest version from: https://github.com/FireFlyForLife/WindowsForceQuit/releases and happy quitting!

## Usage instructions
To use the program, simply launch the exe, it will give you a console with the hotkey you have for quiting an application.
It will also generate a 'configuration.ini' for you, where you can change the hotkey to whatever you want.
By default the hotkey is: F4 + ctrl + shift + alt.

By pressing it you will first 'select' the topmost window as your target. It will flash in the taskbar, and the second time you press the hotkey it will confirm your selection and forcefully quit the selected application.
